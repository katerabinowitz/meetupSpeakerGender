# The Gender Divide of DC Tech + Data Meetup Speakers

#### The Story:

#### Data Source: 
[Meetup API](https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/)

#### Methodology: 
I selected meetup groups that had at least 1,000 members and typically held educational events with one or a few speakers. The meetups used are:

AngularJS DC

D.C. Cyber Security Professionals

Data Education DC

Data Innovation DC

Data Science DC

Data Visualization DC

Data Wranglers DC

DC Natural Language Processing

DC PHP Developer's Community

DCJS

Django District, etc.â„¢

node.dc

Social Data and Analytics - DC

Statistical Programming DC

Tech Talk DC

Washington DC Area Apache Spark Interactive


I collected 2016 events for each meetup. Social and project nights, as well as events not actually hosted by the meetup, were excluded.

In most cases the gender of the speaker was identifiable by the pronoun used in the event description. Where a pronoun was not given, I searched for other online resources that did provide a pronoun. In a few rare cases I used name to indicate gender. 

#### Background:
This post was in part formed through discussions at [Tech Lady Hackathon](http://techladyhackathon.org/) and I'm particularly grateful to [Kiran Bammarito](https://twitter.com/bammarito) and [Hannah Recht](https://twitter.com/hannah_recht) for their guidance.
