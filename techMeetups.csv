As software developers, we go to great lengths to ensure that users can have a seamless experience. However, allowing users to conveniently access their application allows attackers the opportunity to attack users with just as much ease. The eternal struggle that designers and developers face is striking a balance in design and security in order to not compromise the user but optimize his/her satisfaction. This talk will explore some practical strategies that can be implemented in order to improve the security posture of most applications without compromising on the user experience.</p> <p>

<b>Speaker bio:</b> David Vo is a senior consultant with nVisium’s Application Consulting practice. His specialties include application pen-test, source code reviews, and vulnerability analysis, including using fuzzing to find software vulnerabilities. He is also an expert in mobile security, including the Apple iOS and Android platforms.</p> <p>

Many of its members are active in the startup ecosystem, mentoring entrepreneurs and connecting them to business resources, providing critical support to the success of early-stage business and the Texas economy.</i></p> <p><i>CTAN’s mission is two-fold: 1) Provide quality early-stage investment opportunities for accredited angel investors; and 2) Assist entrepreneurs and startups by serving as a key source of funding, mentorship, strategic advice, and educational resources.
